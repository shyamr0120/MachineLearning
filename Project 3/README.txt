README

The MLP_Project3Shyam.ipynb program file contains the code in order to test the Multilayer Perceptron and Linear Regression models.

In the MLP_Project3Shyam.ipynb program file, the Multilayer Perceptron and Linear Regression models will be used to
predict the number of new deaths and the number of total deaths using a dataset that has not been manipulated, a dataset
that has been normalized, and a dataset that has been standardized.

In addition to this, each attribute was taken separately and used to predict the number of new deaths and number of total deaths
with both the Multilayer Perceptron and Linear Regression models. The dataset used for this was normalized.

In order to run the MLP_Project3Shyam.ipynb program file, make sure that that the covid_data.csv file is in the same directory
as the the MLP_Project3Shyam.ipynb program file.

All cells of the MLP_Project3Shyam.ipynb program file must be selected at once and run for the program to work properly.

Notes:
1) The RMSE values given by the Multilayer Perceptron model can vary between each run.
2) It may take anywhere between 15-30 minutes to run the entire program depending on the specs of the computer being used.
Most of this time is taken by the Multilayer Perceptron model.
